            Leveraging extensive knowledge in front-end technologies like
            React.js, Next.js, Angular, and TypeScript, I've designed
            user-centric interfaces. Proficient in UI libraries such as Material
            UI, Bootstrap, and TailwindCSS, enhancing the aesthetics and
            usability of the company's application.
            <br /> <br />
            My back-end expertise enables the creation of scalable server-side
            solutions. I efficiently manage databases using MySQL and deploy
            applications on cloud platforms such as AWS (utilizing services like
            RDS, Load Balancers, and EC2) and Google Cloud Platform services.
            <br /> <br />
            Extensively utilized Node.js and Express to build scalable and
            efficient backend solutions, seamlessly integrating with databases
            for streamlined data management while developing high-performance
            RESTful APIs, facilitating smooth data exchange and real-time
            updates and integrating third-party APIs to the application.
            <br /> <br />
            My approach to development is grounded in agile methodologies, using
            Git and GitHub for version control.
            <br /> <br />
            I'm committed to learning and implementing new technologies,
            focusing on building efficient, maintainable, and scalable systems
            that provide high-quality user experiences and optimal performance.
