            Leveraging extensive knowledge in front-end technologies like
            React.js, Next.js, Angular, and TypeScript, I've designed
            user-centric interfaces. Proficient in UI libraries such as Material
            UI, Bootstrap, and TailwindCSS, enhancing the aesthetics and
            usability of applications.
            <br />
            My back-end expertise includes Node.js and Express.js, enabling the
            creation of scalable server-side solutions. I efficiently manage
            databases using MySQL and MongoDB and deploy applications on cloud
            platforms including AWS (utilizing services like RDS, Load
            Balancers, and EC2) and Google Cloud Platform.
            <br />
            Skilled in creating and maintaining RESTful APIs, I ensure seamless
            data exchange and integration with third-party APIs. My approach to
            development is grounded in agile methodologies, using Git and GitHub
            for version control.
            <br />
            I'm committed to learning and implementing new technologies,
            focusing on building efficient, maintainable, and scalable systems
            that provide high-quality user experiences and optimal performance.
